#  Java Design Patterns
  
This project showcases practical implementations of commonly used design patterns in backend development and system design interviews. Each pattern includes:

- Real-world use cases
- Clean and testable Java code
- Easy-to-understand explanations
- Folder-wise documentation with `README.md`
