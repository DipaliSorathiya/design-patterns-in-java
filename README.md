#  Java Design Patterns
  
This project showcases practical implementations of commonly used design patterns in backend development and system design interviews. Each pattern includes:

- Real-world use cases
- Clean and testable Java code
- Easy-to-understand explanations
- Folder-wise documentation with `README.md`

##  Patterns Implemented

###  Creational Patterns
| Pattern   | Description | Link |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| Singleton | Ensures a class has only one instance | [Go to Singleton](https://github.com/DipaliSorathiya/design-patterns-in-java/blob/main/src/main/java/org/dipali/patterns/creational/singleton/README.md) |
| Factory   | Delegates object creation to a factory class | [Go to Factory](https://github.com/DipaliSorathiya/design-patterns-in-java/blob/main/src/main/java/org/dipali/patterns/creational/factory/README.md) |
| Strategy  | Allows switching between different algorithms at runtime | [Go to Strategy](https://github.com/DipaliSorathiya/design-patterns-in-java/tree/main/src/main/java/org/dipali/patterns/behavioral/Strategy/README.md) |
| Observer  | Automatically notifies subscribed objects on state change | [Go to Observer](https://github.com/DipaliSorathiya/design-patterns-in-java/blob/main/src/main/java/org/dipali/patterns/behavioral/Strategy/README.md)   |
| Adaptor  | allows incompatible classes to work together by converting one interface into another expected by the client. | [Go to Adaptor](https://github.com/DipaliSorathiya/design-patterns-in-java/blob/main/src/main/java/org/dipali/patterns/Structural/Adaptor/README.md)   |
| Builder  | constructs complex objects step-by-step, allowing you to create different representations using the same construction process | [Go to Builder](https://github.com/DipaliSorathiya/design-patterns-in-java/blob/main/src/main/java/org/dipali/patterns/creational/Builder/README.md)   |

##  Why This Project?

As a software engineer transitioning from SDET to Backend Development, I'm deeply committed to writing clean, scalable code.  
This repo reflects:
- My passion for **backend architecture**
- My preparation for **SDE-1/SDE-2 interviews**
- A foundation for developers who want to master design patterns with hands-on code

---

##  Tech Stack

- Java 17+
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Maven
- Git & GitHub

---

## Coming Soon

- Builder Pattern
